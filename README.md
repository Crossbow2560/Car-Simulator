# Car Simulator

This Project is a simple car simulator built using the following components:
- Arduino UNO
- Potentiometers x 2
- Limit Switches x 4
- M274 Rotary encoder

The arduino acts as the main brain for the simulator, It takes the inputs from all the sensors, switches and potentiometers, formats the data into a list and sends it to the python program through serial communication.
